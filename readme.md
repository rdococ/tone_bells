Tone Bells
==========

This is a small proof of concept mod that adds blocks to Minetest called 'tone bells'. Tone bells play notes like note blocks do. Unlike note blocks, you select a note by stacking different kinds of tone bells.

The sound files for tone bells were taken shamelessly from the mesecons_noteblock mod - they are just placeholder sounds.

Kinds
-----

There are 4 kinds of tone bells. There is a starting note, and each tone bell increases the pitch of the note by a certain amount.

* Grey tone bells do not lighten the resulting note at all. Use them to play the starting note and craft the other three tone bells.
* Red tone bells lighten the resulting note slightly.
* Blue tone bells lighten the note considerably.
* Yellow tone bells lighten the note very slightly.

Stack tone bells on top of each other to create different notes. To play the resulting note, punch the stack of bells. You can also activate tone bells with mesecons, allowing you to play several notes at once and form chords.
